# Shazam-algorithm-for-sEMG-signal-Classification

Shazam is an application used for audio segments recognition, based on digital fingerprint which are extracted from
a time-frequency graph (spectrogram). In this approach, we extend its uses to sEMG signal classification

The operation based on two steps: create Digital Fingerprint Table and Search for match in a local dataset.
